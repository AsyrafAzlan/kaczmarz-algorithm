# kaczmarz-algorithm
A simple simulation of Kaczmarz algorithm which I believe inspired modern day optimization methods in machine/deep learning.

Based on the book:

In this simulation, the program is trying to optimize 5 targeted weights with the values:
</br>0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6

It can be seen that the algorithm manages to obtain the targeted weights after approximately 50 steps.
